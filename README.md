# Firecracker
An attempt at making my own little debugger for commandline (like gdb). It goes step by step through an (ELF only so far) executable,
allowing you to view important stack variables.

# Next Steps 
Brandnew project so there's a lot more to do. I want to add a GUI component because there doesn't seem to be any GUI based
Linux Debugger that I know if. Reverse engineering frameworks like Ghidra might have support for something like that, but
I dont know how to do more than static analysis with it (that's also a *massive* project...).
